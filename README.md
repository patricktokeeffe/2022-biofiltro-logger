# BioFiltro Flux Measurements Logger

Program for obtaining meteorological and greenhouse gas (GHG) data from the
sensors listed in the table below using a [CR1000][1] datalogger. Data can be
monitored in real-time using the [LoggerLink][2] app on a phone or tablet while
connected to the trailer's wireless local area network. A user-controlled
processing flag allows for automatic data reduction of measurements made during
a sampling run. Raw measurements are also stored in separate data tables to
permit in-depth analysis. 

Specific instruments include:

* N<sub>2</sub>O/CO trace gas analyzer ([DLT-100 series; Los Gatos Research][5])
	* Nitrous oxide
	* Carbon monoxide
	* Water vapor
* CH<sub>4</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> trace gas analyzer ([UGGA; Los Gatos Research][6])
	* Methane
	* Carbon dioxide
	* Water vapor
* Total weather station ([WXT510; Vaisala][3])
	* Horizontal wind speed & direction 
	* Ambient temperature & relative humidity
	* Barometric pressure
	* Precipitation accumulation (rain & hail)
* Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor ([LI-190SA; LI-COR Biosciences][4])
* GPS receiver (for clock sync) ([GPS16X-HVS; Garmin][8])


## Setup

### Power

Connect trailer power cords to appropriate power sources:

| Cord type | Circuit | Min. breaker size |
|:--|:--|:--:|
| Orange, parallel blade plug | #1, for analyzers | 15A |
| Black, T-blade plug | #2, for air conditioner | 20A |

### Air conditioner

Turn on the A/C to **Cool** mode and set temperature to room temp (**72Â°C** or cooler). 

### Gas analyzers

Refer to manufacturer user guides for complete setup details. Be sure to:

1. Turn on the uninterruptible power supply (hold the power button for 3-5 seconds) before turning on the two trace gas analyzers. 
2. Verify connections for sampling plumbing before plugging in the flushing pump (see diagram below).
3. Verify serial data cables are connected to analyzers.
4. Verify analyzers are configured as described in **Configuration** section.

### Weather station & PAR sensor

The weather station and PAR sensor are mounted on the side of the trailer. Once
the trailer is positioned, remove protective covers items and verify sensors are
correctly deployed so that:

* the weather station is approximately level,
* the weather station is pointing northward (to avoid shading the PAR sensor), *and*
* the PAR sensor is also level 

If the weather station is not oriented exactly to geographic (True) north, the actual
azimuth should be updated in the logger program. See the **Operations** section.

A short step ladder may be required to level the PAR sensor. Refer to the sensor
user manual for mounting plate leveling instructions.


### Datalogger

Turn on the battery-backed power supply in the datalogger enclosure to enable
the logger (also the weather station and datacom equipment).

![Power supply switch location](img/enclosure-power.jpg)

Review and update the following program constants before the start of sampling.
They can be modified using the handheld keyboard display, or by updating the
public Constants table named "`Constants`" and triggering a restart. 

* `UTC_OFFSET` - time offset relative to UTC, in hours (default: `-8` = Pacific Standard Time)
* `PAR_MULT` - unique sensor-specific calibration value, in &micro;mol/(mV s m<sup>2</sup>) (default: `-197.63`)

The following program variable must also be updated when the weather station is
installed and anytime it's adjusted. The variable can be updated by changing
itsvalue in the data table named "`Public`". Changes go into effect immediately
without any program restarts.

* `WXT_AZIMUTH` - orientation of the weather station w.r.t. True North, in degrees (default: `0` = True North)

## Operations

### LoggerLink

The no-cost mobile app [LoggerLink][2] is the recommended datalogger interface.
Connect to the trailer's wireless network and use the search feature, or use
the following setup details to create a new connection manually:

* Address: `192.168.13.50`
* Port: `6785` (default)
* Type: `CR1000`
* Pakbus Address: `1` (default)
* Security code: *update to match logger configuration*

> *Note if the security code does not match the logger, data may still be
viewable but public variables will not be editable and therefore triggering
sample runs will not be allowed.*

![Screenshot of LoggerLink setup](img/loggerlink-setup.jpg)

Alternatively, a handheld keyboard display (CR1000KD; Campbell Scientific) can
be used instead. The main disadvantages of the keyboard display are (1) lack
of interactive data plotting, and (2) being physically constrained by the
display's cable length.

### RealVNC

It is also recommended to have [VNC Viewer][10] or other VNC-compatible client
for remotely viewing and controlling the two trace gas analyzers. Launch the
client and create a new connection for each one:

| Device | IP Address | Port | Password&dagger; |
|:-------|:----------:|:----:|:----------------:|
| N2O/CO analyzer | `192.168.13.51` | `5900` | `lgrvnc` |
| CH4/CO2 analyzer | `192.168.13.52` | `5900` | `lgrvnc` |

&dagger;If the default doesn't work, check the notes in the device user manual.

[<img src="img/vnc-ugga.jpeg" alt="VNC Viewer connected to CH4/CO2 analyzer" width="600">](img/vnc-ugga.jpeg)

### Real-time Monitoring

The recommended method for viewing individual data values is the **Current** interface of LoggerLink.

1. Open settings (gear icon)
2. Select a data table
	* Choose `biofiltro_1hz` for unprocessed (raw) data from the trace gas analyzers
	* Choose `biofiltro_wxt` for unprocessed (raw) data from the weather station
	* Choose `biofiltro_1min` for 1-min averages of weather station, PAR sensor, and temperature data
	* Choose `biofiltro_runs` for data saved from the last sampling run
	* Choose `Public` for the most recent values of run duration, internal datalogger temperature, and temperature of air coming from the AC unit
3. Select relevant fields, as desired.

### Real-time Plotting

The recommended method for plotting data is the **Historical** interface of LoggerLink. 

1. Select up to several individual fields from a single data table
2. Specify the data range (from minutes up to weeks)
3. Optionally configure display formatting for individual fields:
	* Left or right axis
	* Display as line, points, or line + points
	* Set line width / color / styling
	* Set point size / color / shape

### Triggering Sample Runs

Users can capture and reduce data over a particular time window using the
public field `run_flag`. When that field is set to *True*, a new output
interval is created and measurements are included for intermediate processing.
When the `run_flag` field is reset to *False*, final processing occurs and a
new record is stored in data table "`biofiltro_runs`". 

* To begin a sample run, change the public field `run_flag` to *True*.
* To end a sample run and compute run statistics, change the public field `run_flag` to *False*.

The public field `run_flag` can be easily modified using the **Current** screen of the *LoggerLink* app...

1. Ensure the "`Public`" table is selected and all fields are shown.
2. Press and hold the `run_flag` field.
3. In the resulting *Change Value* dialog, update the value and press [OK] to save changes.
    * To begin a run, set the value to *True*
	* To end the run, set the value to *False*

...or with a local keyboard display:

1. Press any key to wake up the keyboard display.
2. Verify the cursor selection is "`Run flag`".
3. Press [Enter] to modify the current value.
4. Select the desired value and press [Enter] to save changes.
    * To begin a run, set the value to *True*
	* To end the run, set the value to *False*

&dagger;The datalogger disables the heater if input voltage is less than 12.6Vdc
to prevent running heaters while on battery power. The WXT510 automatically
engages the heater only at predetermined setpoints so it's fine to leave the
heater voltage normally enabled. 

### QUANTUM (PAR) sensor

The QUANTUM (LI-190SA) sensor typically stays connected to the [Model 2290 Millivolt Adapter][7] (604&ohm;), which is wired to a differential analog
voltage input channel of the logger. Note wiring is polarity-inverted per manufacturer
guidance.

	* Set to the IP reservation described in modem configuration section below
* Appropriate security settings are enabled 

### Raven RV50 cellular modem

The modem provides ~~an internet connection and~~**\*** behaves as the router for the
local area network (LAN). Use default network configuration and update security
settings to comply with best practices and company guidelines.

> *(\*) the modem presently doesn't have an active data plan, so there's no
> internet connection but it still serves the important role of DHCP server*

Verify the modem issues DHCP IP addresses using the default range values:

* LAN > Ethernet
    * Device IP: `192.168.13.31`
    * IP Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
    * DHCP Starting IP: `192.168.13.100`
    * DHCP Ending IP: `192.168.13.150`

Then assign DHCP reservations to ensure devices obtain the same IP address even
if the network gets restarted:

| Device | IP reservation |
|--------|----------------|
| Wireless radio | 192.168.13.**10** |
| CR1000 logger  | 192.168.13.**50** |
| LGR N2O/CO     | 192.168.13.**51** |
| LGR CH4/CO2    | 192.168.13.**52** |

### Picostation M2 wireless radio

The wireless radio provides an access point (AP) so phone or tablet users can
connect to the trailer LAN. The wireless users obtain an IP address from the
modem and appear on the same subnet as the logger, modem, etc. 

* Network
    * Network Mode: `Bridge`
    * Management IP Address: `DHCP`
    * DHCP Fallback: `192.168.13.10`
* Wireless
    * SSID: `WSU Trailer 25012E`
    * WPA2-PSK: `field_research`
    * Channel width: `20 MHz`
